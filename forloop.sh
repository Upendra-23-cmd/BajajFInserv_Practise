# Rules for writing the for loop
#                                way to declare "for" loop :
#                                                   for variable in list; do
#                                                           commands
#                                                   done
echo ""
# Rules
# 1.) must include do ... done in the for loop
# 2.) list can be numbers (1,2,3,4,5) , files(*.txt) or array({a,d,v,b})
# 3.) varible name can be anything but must be meaningful
# 4.) always seperate do from for loop when declareing
